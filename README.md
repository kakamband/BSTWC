Bootstrap studio export to WordPress theme converter

This a basic script that creates a WordPress plugin, creates an extra menu item on the side bar and a page that when opened will find exported bootstrap studio projects and allow them to be converted to a WordPress theme.
I created it to speed up some repetitive tasks in this process. At the moment it requires a strict structure in the HTML created in the bootstrap project, it has no error handling, and the code needs modularizing. 
I believe it has potential to be a useful tool so have put it here to update when I have time.
